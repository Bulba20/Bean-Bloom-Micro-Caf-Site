         <!-- OUR SEASONAL LATTE IS MATCHA LATTE
        
Matcha latte is a popular drink made from matcha green tea powder, hot water, and milk. It can be served hot or cold and has a distinctive, smooth, sweet, slightly bitter taste and distinctive green tea aroma, often with a creamy milky texture. Matcha latte also contains lower amounts of caffeine than coffee and the compound L-theanine, which can help improve focus and calmness.
Basic Ingredients

Matcha Powder: High-quality Japanese green tea powder.
Hot Water: Hot water to dissolve the matcha powder.
Milk: Cow's milk, plant-based milk such as oat or almond, or other creamer.
Sweetener: Sugar, honey, or syrup to taste.-->

espresso and ristretto
The primary difference is volume and flavor intensity: a ristretto is a "restricted" shot of espresso using less water, resulting in a smaller, more concentrated, and often sweeter, richer coffee. An espresso is a more balanced shot, extracted with more water and yielding a fuller, classic coffee flavor that can be more bitter.
            
Flavor Profile 
Espresso:
Offers a balanced and nuanced flavor, often with nutty or chocolate notes, and a classic, bold taste. 
Ristretto:
Due to the reduced water, a ristretto concentrates the initial, sweeter, and more soluble compounds from the coffee, resulting in a stronger, sweeter, and less bitter flavor with a fuller body and more viscous texture. 
Use in Drinks
Espresso: A versatile base for many espresso-based drinks. 
Ristretto: Its intense, rich flavor is perfect for cutting through milk in drinks like Flat Whites or Cortados, giving a creamy yet strong taste.
